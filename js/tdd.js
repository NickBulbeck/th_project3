/*******************************************************************
As the name implies, this file is created as a technical exercise to
provide unit tests for the functions in the app, and supports basic
TDD.
It's a technical exercise because there are many frameworks in
existence that provide the same functionality (and more), but this
is developed from scratch. The entire purpose of this app is 
learning, so hand-crafting a simple TDD framework is a suitable 
activity here.
(Practicing importing and using an external framework is ALSO a good
learning activity, but this can wait a few weeks until the course
moves on to NodeJS. At that point I'll probably switch to Mocha.)
